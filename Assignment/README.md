Assignment:

Write programs in assembly language and also in C language to create a continuous square waveform (high and low logic levels) in output of PORT B.4 pin with 60% duty cycle having successive incremental (and later on decremented) frequencies of 10 Hz, 20 Hz, 30 Hz, 40 Hz….100Hz, 90 Hz, 80 Hz, 70 Hz,…10 Hz in succeeding cycles of the waveform. That is, duration of first complete cycle is 0.1 s (ON time= 0.06 s and OFF time= 0.04 seconds), duration of next complete cycle of waveform is 0.05 seconds (ON time= 0.03 s and OFF time= 0.02 seconds) and so on.
